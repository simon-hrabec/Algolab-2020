# Algolab2020
Solutions for problems given in ETH course [Algorithms Lab in Fall 2020](https://www.cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS20/algolab/index.html).

The code for these problems is written with the following in mind:
- Readability. It is prevalent in competitive programming to use macros, and extremely dense and unreadable code. I dont find the price for longer names and few more lines too high. I often rewrite the problems to try something new or to see performance gain/loss therefore even I appreciate this.
- Performance. Lot of the problems could be solved with considerably less code. It would pass within the time limits. However, I tried to make the code run fast to a reasonable extent.
- Code quality. I know this is competitive programming and it does not matter much here but I found out I do better when I go a bit slower in terms of writing code and then avoid some of small bugs/issues. This is the main reason why you can see `const` everywhere and special function to load data (to have the loaded data also const).

Should you find some typo, bug, improvement or anything related feel free to message me at my email `simon.hrabec` on gmail.

How to use this repository:
- Copy-paste relevant code snippets to begin your work
- If stuck and gave the problem already some time read the minimal amount of problem solution to get yourself unstuck
- After finishing the task check the solutions for alternative ways to approach it
- Check the code if you just wanna compare the code of your solution and see how other people write C++
